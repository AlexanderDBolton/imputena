values in datasets. The treatments that are implemented are:

* Listwise deletion
* Pairwise deletion
* Dropping variables
* Random sample imputation
* Random hot-deck imputation
* LOCF
* NOCB
* Most frequent substitution
* Mean and median substitution
* Constant value imputation
* Random value imputation
* Interpolation
* Interpolation with seasonal adjustment
* Linear regression imputation
* Stochastic regression imputation
* Logistic regression imputation

## Installation

### Most recent release

To install or update to the most recently published release, run:

```ShellSession

## Tests

The tests for the implemented functions are located in the test directory and
use the unittest package.

To execute all tests, run the following command at the project root directory:

```ShellSession
python -m unittest
```

To execute only the tests contained in a particular test class, for example
test_delete_listwise.py, run the following command at the project root
directory:

```ShellSession
python -m unittest test.test_delete_listwise
```

## Documentation
